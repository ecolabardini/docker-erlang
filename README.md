## Erlang & OTP

#### What is Erlang

Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

Please see the [Erlang website](http://www.erlang.org/) or the [Erlang Quick Start](http://www.erlang.org/static/getting_started_quickly.html).

#### What is OTP

OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging and release handling tools.

Please see the [OTP Quickstart](http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/users_guide.html).
